## Super-Duper Breakout
Final for *Intro to Computer Programming II (Spring 2024)*

**Minimum Viable Product**:

Start screen, win & lose screen. The user controls the paddle with the keyboard/ arrow keys. A ball bounces off the paddle, the walls, and the bricks. When a brick is hit by the ball, it is destroyed, and you gain a point. You lose if the ball goes off the bottom of the screen. If you clear every brick, you win. When you win or lose, a high score screen is shown.

**Optional Features**:

Each brick is worth a different number of points (the top bricks give you more points). The player has 3 lives, if the ball goes off the bottom of the screen it removes a life and respawns at the top of the screen until the player runs out of lives. The ball speed increases when the player clears a certain number of bricks.

**Stretch Goal**:

Optional full-screen mode. Some bricks have special abilities like spawning extra balls or shortening/ extending the paddle. When the entire screen is cleared, the bricks respawn, and the speed increases.
